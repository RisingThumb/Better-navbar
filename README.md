# Better Nav Bar

This is a werc app that improves the nav bar for werc.

Depends on xsltproc and tree.

Style.css provided is a suggestion and is what is used on risingthumb.xyz. Added these lines to the bottom of your stylesheet or include it in your default master template header section.

tree uses a gitignore file in order to handle deciding what files and folders to ignore. A sample ignore file is provided. The TreeXSL.xsl provides an XSLT mapping that maps from the tree xml output to the navbar HTML output.
